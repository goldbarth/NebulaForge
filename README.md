Nebula Forge - Simulation / Unity, C#
======================
*A Combination of Engine-Tool-Development and Game-World-Editor.*
-----------------------

The almighty and likeable Sebastian Lague served as inspiration :)

It is a mixture of lecture material, internet content, plus modifications and adaptations on my part.

I developed the engine tool myself. It has its limits, which had to do with the time available. 
On the whole, I am very satisfied, but I also see room for improvement and expansion.
