## Noise Settings

In the Noise Settings (also Simple and Ridgid), I extracted the nested classes and made them their own files. 
I added extensions to reuse code for the NoiseFilter classes.
I also added a few comments to the code. I tried to get rid of the "conditional hide attribute" class with inheritance, 
but the classes then didnt appear in the inspector.
