# Planet Generation
The original code was from the Sebastian Lague´s tutorial "Procedural Planets".
Modified from Léon-Lucas Kaniewski @ SAE "Generische Welten" Online Lecture.
Modified and finalized by me, for my own project.

## Noise Settings (Folder)
- In the Noise Settings (also Simple and Ridgid), I extracted the nested classes and made them their own files. 
- I added extensions to reuse code for the NoiseFilter classes.
- I also added a few comments to the code. I tried to get rid of the "conditional hide property drawer" class, 
with making the Simple and Ridgid inherit from a abstract class, but the classes then didnt appear in the inspector as expected.
